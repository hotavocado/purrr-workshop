#' Use `rmarkdown::render()` on this or, in RStudio, click on the "Compile Report" spiral-notebook icon.

#' ## Where to find this document
#'
#' Shortlink humans can type:
#'
#'   * <http://bit.ly/jenny-live-code>
#'
#' Horrible link that reveals how this is done:
#'
#'   * <https://www.dropbox.com/s/2b8mi4rir23pvnx/jenny-live-code.R?raw=1>
#'
#' Using the `raw=1` query trick for rendering a DropBox-hosted file in the
#' browser:
#'
#'   * <https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/desktop-web/force-download>
#' learned from [Michael Levy](https://twitter.com/ucdlevy).
#'
#' How this works:
#'
#'   * I code live in an R script locally. I save often.
#'   * This file lives in a directory synced to DropBox.
#'   * You open the DropBox file at <http://bit.ly/jenny-live-code> and refresh
#'   as needed.
#'   * Should allow you to see, copy, paste everything I've typed and save the
#'   entire transcript at the end. This file is highly perishable, so save your
#'   own copy if you want it.
#'   * Every now and then the refresh won't work. Just re-open from from the
#'   bit.ly link: <http://bit.ly/jenny-live-code>
